is 3rd order better than 2nd? yes for both mass and consumption

what we really care about is the 3rd order function significant with interactions with temp by treatment

remove interaction and test those models

don't care about each of those terms, want to show that the curve of mass by age differs for diff temps and treatments

model doesn't fit well at young ages, response to reviewer is that at low temperatures, the growth is disrupted because the interval spent not eating during molting is greater
so the model fits better at older ages (smaller values of residuals), and we don't really care that it doesn't fit well at younger (esp at 20)
